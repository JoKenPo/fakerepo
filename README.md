# FakeRepo [Em Construção]

FakeRepo is an experimental project exploring concepts in web development, including:

- **Monorepo:** Managing both backend and frontend projects in a single repository.
- **Real-time communication:** Utilizing Socket.IO to synchronize data between clients.
- **Full-stack development:** Building a complete application, from backend to user interface.

**Goal:**

The primary goal of this project is to create an application similar to Google Sheets, enabling collaborative editing and instant data updates among users.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend:** [List the technologies used in the backend, such as Node.js, Express, MongoDB, etc.]
- **Frontend:** [List the technologies used in the frontend, such as React, Next.js, etc.]
- **Communication:** Socket.IO

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/JoKenPo/fakerepo
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the server:**

   ```bash
   npm run dev:server
   ```

   This will start the backend server on port 4003.

4. **Start the frontend:**

   ```bash
   npm run dev:web
   ```

   This will start the frontend on port 3000.

Now you can access the application at http://localhost:3000 in your browser.
